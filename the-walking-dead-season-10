The Walking Dead Season 10 Episode Release Date, trailer, plot, cast

Are you a walking dead fan? Well, I am a die-hard fan of this amazing series and it is not surprising that we have begun the tenth chapter of “The Walking Dead”. This a thrilling series composed of a full zombie apocalypse that began with Rick Grimes waking up alone in a hospital way back in 2010. We have seen for ages that survivors are making a very small process in building up a safe place to live which is constantly threatened by sick and bad people out there. Even the ocean is not a safe place to live it also has human threats all over. The Walking Dead Season 10 has begun with tons of questions in mind: will the survivors suffer the same scene again? Does it actually cross the line just like the Episode 1 storyline says? Can’t say anything because even you know that they will be having suspense and thrill over each road turn.
